# cpkg v1.1.2 Release Notes

## Overview

cpkg v1.1.2 is a patch release that fixes binary naming in releases and reorganizes release notes. This release ensures all platform-specific binaries are correctly included in GitHub releases.

## Installation

### From Source (Recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/SCKelemen/cpkg@v1.1.2
```

### Pre-built Binaries

Download pre-built binaries for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/SCKelemen/cpkg/releases) page:

- **Linux (amd64)**: `cpkg-linux-amd64`
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `cpkg-darwin-arm64`

After downloading, make the binary executable and move it to your PATH:

```bash
# Linux
chmod +x cpkg-linux-amd64
sudo mv cpkg-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cpkg

# macOS
chmod +x cpkg-darwin-arm64
sudo mv cpkg-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/cpkg
```

## What's New

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Binary Naming in Releases

Previously, all binaries were named `cpkg` which caused them to overwrite each other when preparing the release. Now binaries are renamed to include platform and architecture information:

- `cpkg-linux-amd64` - Linux x86_64
- `cpkg-darwin-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon

This ensures all platform-specific binaries are included in GitHub releases.

### Improvements

#### Release Notes Organization

- Moved all release notes to `docs/releases/{version}.md` for better organization
- Updated release workflow to automatically find and include release notes from the new location

## Migration Guide

### From v1.1.1 to v1.1.2

No breaking changes. This is a patch release with bug fixes.

**No action required** - you can upgrade directly:

```bash
go install github.com/SCKelemen/cpkg@v1.1.2
```

Or if using pre-built binaries, download the new version from the [Releases](https://github.com/SCKelemen/cpkg/releases) page. Note that binary names now include platform information.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git (for submodule management)
