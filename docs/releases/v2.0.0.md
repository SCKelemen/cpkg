## What's New

### Breaking Changes

#### Command Rename: `outdated` → `check`

**Breaking:** The `outdated` command has been renamed to `check` for better clarity and consistency with common package manager conventions.

**Migration:**
- Replace `cpkg outdated` with `cpkg check`
- Update any scripts, CI/CD workflows, or documentation that references `cpkg outdated`
- The GitHub Action `cpkg-upgrade` has been updated to use the new command name

**Example:**

# Old (v1.x)
cpkg outdated

# New (v2.0.0+)
cpkg check
```

### Improvements

#### Fixed Release Binary Naming
